            <p class="font-justify">The Holy Qurán is written in the purest and most perfect form of Arabic. It has
                about 77,640 words and is
                divided
                into chapters and verses. The chapters are called suras, which are 114 in all. The opening chapter of
                the
                Holy
                Quran is very short, having six lines. We Muslims repeat it several times a day, and it is called the
                Fatiha,
                that is, the preface or introduction. It at once affects the feelings of a true Muslim.</p>
